# aws_proxy
Creating a proxy server switcher with AWS

I wrote this script to automate the process of starting an AWS Ubuntu server, creating an ssh tunnel to it, and configuring a Mac to connect to the server and use it as a Socks proxy.

The first version of this script assumes that you have an AWS account, Python, and AWS cli tools installed. I plan to do a write up on getting AWS and the associated tools setup. 

This script is written to function in Bash on OS X.
